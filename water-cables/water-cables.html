    <h2>Water in Cables</h2>
    <p>Most winter cyclists have probably felt this at least once. You pull your brake levers or try to shift gears but
        cables are not responding and won't move. There are a few possible causes for this, but in my experience this is usually a symptom
        of water that managed to get trapped inside of the cable housing.</p>
    <p>This section will describe my experience with this situation and how one can minimize this problem with the equipment I am familiar with.</p>

    <h3>Gear cable</h3>

    <p>I ride a bike equipped with a Shimano Alfine 8-speed internal hub.
        The first year I had this bike, the hub operated perfectly until
    the first cold spells happened. Typically, the symptom was that the gears wouldn't shift well or at all. On this hub, upshifting means
    pulling the cable away from the hub by applying strength on the lever, and downshifting means giving some slack to the cable so that the hub springs might pull it back towards the hub.</p>
    <p>Sometimes upshifting was possible by pulling very hard on the lever. However, once I had upshifted this way I could not shift back down because the hub springs
        were simply not powerful enough to move the cable back.
        On a few occasions, I found myself having to ride on the 1st or 2nd gear the whole commute, which was not great. This even sometimes combined with non-functional hydrolic brakes,
        which really set the stage for a tough ride!
    </p>
    <p>Problems with shifting seemed to
    happened more frequently when below-freezing temperature followed above-freezing ones. Bringing the bike inside a heated area would fix the problem
    temporarily (say for the first 10 minutes of riding), but then the shifter would start being hard to use again.</p>
    <p>When reporting the issue to the LBS, I was given common advices such as lubricating the cable. The shop tried
        that but it didn't really help much with the situation.</p>
    <p>The Shimano hub uses full-length cable housing running from the shifter to the hub.
        Some research led me to believe that the situation was caused by water entering the cable and getting trapped.
        Because my cable was routed as per the figure below on the left-hand side, there was a low spot where water might accumulate.</p>
    <p>This made sense with the symptoms I was getting. The bike would operate well in the summer or in the first 10 minutes after taking it outdoors, but not when left
        in the cold for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>The solution to this issue was to convert the cable routing into what is shown on the right-hand side.</p>

    <p>On the picture on the left, water that is splashing from the street or incoming from above and entering the cable housing
        gets pulled by gravity towards a spot somewhere along the horizontal chain stay at the bottom of the frame.</p>

    <p>On the right, however, water that might find itself entering the housing will naturally flow back out.</p>
