    <h2>Water in Cables</h2>
    <p>
      Most winter cyclists have probably gone through this at least once. You pull your
      brake levers or try to shift gears but cables are not responding and won't
      move. There are a few possible causes, but in my experience a stuck cable
      is usually a symptom of water that managed to get trapped inside of the
      cable housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section will describe my experience with this situation and how one
      can minimize this problem with the equipment I am familiar with.
    </p>

    <p>TL; DR: Water in cables is the winter cyclist's #1 enemy. Route your cables with downwards slopes and use cable boots to minimize issues.</p>

    <h3>Gear cable</h3>

    <p>
      I ride a bike equipped with a Shimano Alfine 8-speed internal hub. The
      first year I had this bike, the hub operated perfectly until the first
      cold spells happened. Typically, the symptom was that the gears wouldn't
      shift well or at all. On this hub, downshifting means pulling the cable
      away from the hub by applying strength on the lever, and upshifting means
      giving some slack to the cable so that the hub springs might pull it back
      towards the hub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes downshifting was possible by pulling very hard on the lever.
      However, once I had downshifted this way I could not shift back up because
      the hub springs were simply not powerful enough to move the cable back. On
      a few occasions, I found myself having to ride on the 1st or 2nd gear the
      whole commute, which was not great. This even sometimes combined with
      non-functional hydraulic brakes, which really set the stage for a tough
      ride!
    </p>
    <p>
      Problems with shifting seemed to happened more frequently when
      below-freezing temperature followed above-freezing ones. Bringing the bike
      inside a heated area would fix the problem temporarily (say for the first
      10 minutes of riding), but then the shifter would start being hard to use
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When reporting the issue to the LBS, I was given common advices such as
      lubricating the cable. The shop tried that but it didn't really help much
      with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shimano hub uses full-length cable housing running from the shifter to
      the hub. Some research led me to believe that the situation was caused by
      water entering the cable and getting trapped. The way my cable was routed,
      there was a low spot where water might accumulate. Once the water was in
      there, it would freeze and block the operation of the cable until it was
      manually removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made sense with the symptoms I was getting. The bike would operate
      well in the summer or in the first 10 minutes after taking it outdoors,
      but not when left in the cold for a long time. The LBS fixed the immediate
      problem once by removing the cable and blowing the water away from the
      housing, but it occurred again some time later.
    </p>

    <h3>Routing the gear cable with a downwards slope</h3>
    <p>
      The solution to the water issue was to convert the cable routing from what
      is shown in the left-hand side picture below into the situation on the
      right-hand side.
    </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      On the picture on the left, water that is splashing from the street or
      incoming from above and entering the cable housing gets pulled by gravity
      towards a low spot somewhere along the horizontal chain stay at the bottom
      of the frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the right, however, the gear cable has been routed such that water that might
      find itself entering the housing will naturally flow back out.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting the perfect hub angle with the Shimano Alfine 8 hub</h3>

    <p>
      While the previous illustrations make sense in theory, how does one make
      the necessary modifications in practice? It turns out that with the
      Shimano Alfine 8 hub, this is a relatively simple operation that can be
      done with basic mechanical skills or with the help of a LBS. This solution
      was proposed by the head mechanic of
      <a href="https://www.dumoulinbicyclettes.com/">Dumoulin Bicyclettes</a>,
      the LBS where I had bought my bike.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Alfine 8 hub comes with blue and green non-turn washers that hold it
      at a fixed angle and keep it from spinning with respect to the frame.
      Normally, the blue washer is installed on the right-hand side and the
      green one on the left. This configures the hub such that the arm that
      receives the gear cable is horizontally aligned with the chain stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly, by swapping the two washers, it is possible to install the
      hub such that the arm is aligned almost exactly with the seat stay
      instead!
    </p>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      I don't know if that is a purposeful design from Shimano, but this neat
      trick makes a very easy fix to this common problem. Either way, I must thank
      Shimano and my mechanic who suggested the swap!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last part of the modification is simply to re-route the gear cable
      along the seat stay and the top tube. Equipped with those instructions,
      any LBS can easily make that fix. It might make the bike slightly less
      pretty and the cable might have to be attached with tie-wraps but hey,
      you'll have functioning gears 365 days a year. Well worth it if you ask
      me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you may wonder if the new cable route might not create a low spot
      near the lever instead. In my case, the cable goes horizontally or might
      have a slight low point around where it leaves the frame to reach the
      lever. In practice I found out that it does not create any problem. I
      believe that most of the water enters from the lower end of the cable near
      the hub and that water entering from above is minimal.

    <h3>Brake cables</h3>

    <p>
      Regarding brake cables, frozen water stuck inside may prevent brakes from
      being pulled and cause safety hazards. In practice, I have found that
      water inside of brake cables creates less problems than with gear cables.
      Usually, when brake cables are stuck, pumping the brakes really hard a few
      times gets them unstuck. There is no "giving slack" movement such as with
      gear cables that can be impeded by frozen water, such that you always have
      your full strength to get them unstuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Regarding parts, I use Avid BB7 disc brakes which have full-length housing
      and a cable boot at the end. Full disclaimer: I selected those over the
      similar and slightly cheaper BB5 just because of the boot which the BB5
      lack. I had such a bad experience with my gear cable that I wanted to make
      sure it would not repeat with the brakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunatly, with disc brakes there is no option to change routing angles
      and on my bike the rear cable has a low spot near the caliper, because it
      routes the cable along the chain stay. The rear brake cable is visible on
      the <a href="#gear-cable-close">hub close-up picture</a> on the far side
      of the rear wheel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, the cable boot seems to be doing a good enough job of
      keeping water away.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="bb7-boot.jpg" style="max-width: 500px; height: auto" />
      <figcaption>
        <b
          >Cable boots on the Avid BB7 provide a layer of protection against
          water entering the housing</b
        >
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In summary, with the BB7 and the boot properly positioned I rarely get
      issues with my cables except in extremely cold weather such as below -20
      &#8451;. In that case
      <a href="../storage/storage.html#extreme-cold"
        >I suspect some other issue at play</a
      >, maybe cable stiffness due to the cold, because cables operate fine if
      the next day is milder even though below freezing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One last note about the cable boot: on the BB7 it does not look strongly
      attached and might sometimes move out of place. Inspect it regularly to
      make sure it does its job!
    </p>

    <h3>Temporary fix to water-in-cable</h3>
    It is always preferable to find long-term fixes to mechanical problems with
    winter biking if you want to enjoy the experience and come back to your bike
    day after day. Nevertheless, it is sometimes handy to come up with quick
    fixes to get unblocked. If you suspect water is entering the cable, you
    might try the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Suspending the bike vertically in a heated place to allow water to drip
        out
      </li>
      <li>
        Removing the cable and blowing inside of the housing to remove water
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When water in cables is suspected, it might be tempting to move the bike
      inside in the hope that it will "warm up" and dry. In this situation, any
      "fix" that is introduced by heating the bike will be temporary and revert
      itself once the bike is ridden outside for a few minutes when the water
      freezes back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, by hanging the bicycle vertically in a heated location (using a
      wall mount in the house for example), water that accumulated in the cable
      that might otherwise stay frozen if the bike was stored outside will melt
      and drop during the night. The bike will then be great to use on the next
      day! I once had a colleague who was commuting with the same bike as I was.
      Frustratingly, I would experience water in the cables and he wouldn't. I
      was puzzled by this until I realized that he was storing his bike
      vertically inside his flat while I was leaving it in an unheated location.
      Although I never tried it myself, I gave this trick to a few people and it
      seems to help them with this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the option to blow the water out: it will work until water
      reenters, but you're not going to do this 10 times per winter. Besides,
      once the cable is pulled out of the housing, it might not be possible to
      place it back if the ending is too worn out and you'll need to replace it.
      Please only take your cable out if you have a replacement handy, or you'll
      have to skip on biking for the next days until you replace it!
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>This section described my experience with the Shimano Alfine 8 internal gear hub and Avid BB7 brakes using full-length housing cables. Full-length housing is good in general because it provides additional protection to your cables but it is not often installed in a winter-proof way. I find that
        with these two parts properly installed with downwards slopes or cable boots, I have a minimum amount of issues with my cables.</p>
        <p>
         There is no need for lubricating or
        any other maintenance tasks with such equipment and the bike is usable 365 days a year. I do not have experience with other internal hubs or mechanical disc brakes but the main
        idea described here should apply to other parts.
        If suspecting water in your cables, inspect how the routing of the cable is done on your bike. In case this is the issue, ask your LBS for a fix to make sure the slopes are downwards and there is no low point.
