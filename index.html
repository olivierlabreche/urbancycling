      Welcome to this very plain and opinionated page about four-seasons biking
      in the city!
    </p>
    <h3>What is this exactly?</h3>
    <p>
      This page covers all kinds of topics around cycling in an urban
      environment with important seasonal variations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention is to address themes such as winter cycling, safety, road
      sharing, equipement, maintenance, part selection and Montreal-specific
      issues, without being overly technical.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is based on my personal experience, trials and multiple errors. The
      point of view is that of a "normal" person trying to ride hassle-free and
      safely from A to B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people do not really care about how their car is designed and
      operates, and it should be the same thing with a bike. It will not
      document each and every possible aspect of cycling. There are no
      exhaustive comparison charts between different products.
    </p>

    <p>
      So if you are looking for the ISO size of your nominally 26 inches tire on
      your 70s Schwinn bike, this might not be exactly the right place for you.
      Nevertheless, I hope you will find it enjoyable :)

    <h3>About the author</h3>
    <p>
      I am located in Montreal, Canada, which gets its fair amount of snow every
      year. A lot of what you are going to read is based on years of riding in
      this specific city. It may not necessarily apply to a location with
      different weather, infrastructure or bike culture!
    </p>
    <p>
      As much as I would love to contribute regularly, I am maintaining this in
      my free time and one should not expect frequent updates. The web page is
      barebone on purpose and this should not change in the near term.
