    <h2>Left Turns</h2>
    This sections describes the different ways in which a cyclist might handle a
    left turn at an intersection, as well as giving some safety and route
    planning tips.
    <h3>
      I learned how to turn when I was 5. Can we move on to the next topic?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Actually, left turns are one of the most tricky situations to handle for
      novice or experienced cyclists alike. They can be a source of confusion
      and stress, and even trigger conflicts between drivers and cyclists.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, it is important to carefully plan one's route to minimize
      the occurence of difficult left turns. When they cannot be avoided, one
      should ideally decide ahead of time what strategy will be used at a given
      intersection. In my experience, leaving that decision to the last minute
      can lead to impulsive and unsafe riding.
    </p>
    <h3>Right-hand traffic vs left-hand traffic</h3>
    <p>
      In most of the world, traffic keeps to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic"
        >right side of the road</a
      >. This being said, a around a third of the world population lives under
      left-hand traffic (LHT) rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Britain aside, many of the places that still have LHT are former British
      colonies, such as India, though there are others left-hand driving
      countries without a history of British colonialism like Japan and
      Indonesia.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you might have guessed, this page is written under the assumption of
      right-hand traffic, though the concepts are analoguous for right turns in
      left-hand traffic zones.
    </p>
    <h3>Defining the types of left turns</h3>
    <p>
      The following picture illustrates three common ways in which a cyclist can
      handle a left turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the sake of this post, let's call them as follows (ordered in terms of
      preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</a></b> (in blue)
      </li>

      <li>
        <b><a href="#zigzag">The "Zigzag"</a></b> (in red)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</h3>
    <p>
      As the name hints, this type of turn simply consists in turning mostly
      like a car would. Although it sounds simple, many novice cyclists are
      intimidated by this maneuver because it involves taking space in the left
      lane, amongst traffic and far from the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ok not to feel comfortable turning this way and many cyclists who
      have ridden for a long time are still avoiding it. However, it can save
      time for those cyclists who feel at ease taking their share of the road.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before the turn, the cyclist signals left and steers towards the
        left-hand side of the road. Where exactly a cyclist should position
        himself depends on the type of intersection and number of lanes, but in
        general the center of the leftmost lane makes the most sense (more on
        positioning later).
      </li>

      <li>
        When the light turns green, the cyclist yields to the oncoming traffic
        in the other direction driving through the intersection or turning
        right.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is no longer any oncoming traffic, the cyclist turns left,
        sticking to the center of the left lane.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the 90&#176; turn is completed, the cyclist immediatly signals
        right and moves towards the right-hand side.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This turn is my personal favorite when it can be executed safely. In
      general, it is the fastest turn of the three as it requires at most a
      single traffic light cycle.
    </p>
    <h3>Things to be mindful about with the Driver's Turn</h3>
    <h4>Yielding to right-turning traffic</h4>
    Sometimes there will be a lot of cars across the intersection that want to
    turn right, towards the same direction where you are heading. If you are
    lucky, one of those drivers will be nice enough to let you go through even
    though he has priority.<br /><br />This situation can be tricky when there
    are multiple lanes on the road where you are turning. A car facing this
    situation would typically turn in the left lane while the right-turning
    traffic would take the right one. This is not really an option for cyclists
    who are supposed to stick to the right-hand side once they finished their
    turn. If cars are waiting behind, they may become impatient. Remember that
    it's your right to wait in the left lane until you can safely turn.
    <h4>Being overtaken from the right by a left-turning car</h4>
    <p>
      Occasionally, a driver might take place on your right and turn left at the
      same time as you. This situation can happen if you are positioned too much
      towards the left-hand side or not clearly signalling your intention to
      turn left. Even if you did everything right, you may also simply be pushed
      around by an abusive driver who does not like waiting behind a cyclist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened to me once. After the turn, I was not able to move back
      towards the right-hand side of the street because a car would be on my
      right and was obviously not in a mood to yield to a cyclist. The driver
      probably thought it was fun to watch a poor cyclist stuck in the middle of
      a busy road making gestures of despair and stuck out her best finger.
      There is unfortunately not much to be done with such lunacy, and I
      accelerated to overtake the next car stuck in traffic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presumably, if the person behind the wheel seems like a decent human being
      and the error was done in good faith, it might be best to keep calm,
      signal right and hope that the driver will let you get through. Prevention
      is always a good idea - by staying in the center of the left lane, it
      becomes harder for a car to pretend you are not there.
    </p>
    <h4>Communication</h4>
    With this type of turn, clearly signalling your intention to turn left is
    extremely important. Many drivers are not aware that cyclists are perfectly
    entitled to turn from the left-hand side of the road. Sometimes cars might
    have arrived at the intersection later than you and did not see you steering
    and signalling to the left when you were taking position in the left lane.
    Ideally, one should stick out an arm during the whole time where one is
    waiting for the light to turn green. This can be bothersome. Personally, I
    will typically raise it every 10 seconds or so, or when I hear a car
    arriving behind me.
    <h4>Moving left before reaching the intersection</h4>
    <p>
      This is the trickest part and is a skill that is improved with practice.
      The cyclist has to be positioned left by the time he reaches the stop line
      of the intersection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sometimes see novice cyclists suddently turning left from the right-hand
      side of the road once they reach the stop line. This is quite dangerous as
      the cyclist might cut off incoming traffic and surprise drivers. Because
      the cyclist has to look out both for traffic coming from behind and in the
      opposite direction, it is easy to make a mistake and fail to see a driver
      coming by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better option is to make a move towards the left of the road ahead of
      the intersection, but it is not always easy. The ideal situation is when
      there is a gap in traffic around 10 seconds before arriving at the
      intersection, which makes it easy to move towards the left just in time
      and avoids staying there for an incomfortably long stretch of road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In theory the cyclist can move towards the left whenever the road is free
      behind him, which means that on busier roads he would be right to take his
      space on the left lane whenever conditions are safe to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practice, this can be intimidating and I wouldn't recommend it for
      busier streets with high-speed traffic. I have been honked and overtaken
      by the right a few times trying this approach on main arteries and it's an
      unnecessary stress that I don't need in my day. Some cyclists are able to
      keep their cool and might be able to calmly explain to toxic drivers why
      it is their right to be there. If this is you, please keep it up! In other
      cases, the L-turn might be a wiser choice. With time, you will get a feel
      for the situations in which you are comfortable with performing this
      maneuver.
    </p>

    <h3 id="l-turn">L-Turn</h3>
    <p>
      This is the basic maneuver that most cyclists would instinctively perform
      when they need to make a left turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With L-turns, the intersection is crossed in two steps and the cyclist
      always stays on the right-hand side of road. It is a perfectly fine turn,
      though maybe "boring", and well-suited to busy or large intersections.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The cyclist approaches the intersection as he usually would if going
        straight, staying as far right as reasonable. One exception would be if
        the right-hand most lane is reserved for right-turning traffic, in which
        case the cyclist can move to the next lane.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the light turns green, the cyclist crosses the perpendicular street
        and aims towards the corner in front of him. The pedestrian cycle might
        also be used for this by walking or even riding carefully (dependent on
        local rules).
      </li>
      <li>
        The cyclist may optionally disembark the bike and wait on the sidewalk
        at the corner, until the other street may be crossed. Alternatively, the
        cyclist might wait on his bike in the curb near the corner. The decision
        depends on factors such as how busy the intersection is, the curb width
        or whether there are cycling lanes that the cyclist might be blocking.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cyclist crosses the second traffic light when it is his turn and
        continues his way on the right-hand side of the street towards his
        destination. Again, walking or biking are two options here.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Things to be mindful about with the L-Turn</h3>
    <h4>Sticking to the plan</h4>
    <p>
      In some cases, one might have been preparing for an L-turn but decides to
      change to a botched driver's turn at the last minute. This is tempting as
      it allows completing the maneuver in one single cycle. In my opinion, this
      is not a safe behavior and should be avoided, but hey, we're all humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find that it helps to plan the left-turn strategy ahead of time to
      prevent this impulsive move. If this happens a lot at a specific
      intersection on your commute, it might be a sign that it would be better
      handled through a driver's turn.
    </p>
    <h4>Not being an obstacle while waiting</h4>
    <p>
      As a general rule, one should avoid blocking any type of traffic while
      waiting at the far corner (pedestrian, cycling or driving). If there are
      cycling or pedestrian lanes near where you are waiting, or if the car
      traffic comes close to the sidewalk, you want to make sure you are out of
      the way. This is usually the main reason why I would wait on the sidewalk
      as opposed to on the street.
    </p>
    <h4>Merging with traffic after the second crossing</h4>
    <p>
      This danger can be easy to overlook. When doing an L-turn and crossing
      from corner to corner, the cyclist is separated from the car traffic.
      After the second crossing, the cyclist has to quickly merge back onto the
      street to take his place in the curb and avoid obstacles such as parked
      cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      When performed in a sudden manner, this move can surprise drivers, so it
      is important to signal your intention of merging back in the traffic,
      especially if the road is busy behind you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This issue is less of a problem if you positioned yourself to be in the
      curb with the traffic on the perpendicular street while waiting for the
      second crossing. In some situations, it makes sense to reposition oneself
      at the corner bewteen the 1st and 2nd crossings to be ready to hit the
      road when the light turns green.
    </p>
    <h3 id="zigzag">The "Zigzag"</h3>
    <p>
      What I call the "zigzag" move consists in crossing the current street
      first, then the perpendicular street. In some ways it is a mirror image of
      the L-turn, but because there are three 90&#176; turns, it looks more like
      an ugly "Z" than a nice "L". As you might have guessed from the name, I
      find this maneuver tricky and dangerous and would not recommend it, unless
      done completely as a pedestrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reason I am against this move is that it puts the cyclist on the
      left side of the street while crossing which is not natural. Turning cars
      tend to not to be watchful for cyclists circulating on the left-hand side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make things worse, a cyclist will be tempted to cross the first street
      from a high-speed riding position in the lane, suddenly making a sharp
      left turn towards an unnatural direction. In my opinion, moving with the
      flow of the traffic is a common-sense strategy which is preferable to this
      type of maneuver. I will not further discuss it here, but would love your
      feedback on this part, especially if you find this move useful for you!
    </p>
    <h3>Lane positioning</h3>

    With the L-Turn, there is no question about where the cyclist should be
    positioned at the intersection. However, things can get confusing with the
    Driver's Turn. Cyclists are not naturally enclined to think about which lane
    they should use - they usually stick to the curb.

    <h4>Multi-lane intersections</h4>
    <p>
      In Canada, multi-lane intersections are often marked with arrows to
      indicate the allowed directions of traffic for each lane. When turning
      left, one should follow the rightmost lane where left turns are allowed.
      The reason is simple: after the turn, it has to be easy to move back to
      the curb. As discussed earlier, I would avoid getting too close to the
      left of the lane to make sure that cars wait behind. I find that staying
      in the center of the turning lane is usually a good rule of thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the lane turning left also allows going straight, the cyclist might
      move a bit more towards the left as an to make it easier for drivers going
      straight to get around him.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For single lane streets, the cyclist should move towards the left of the
      lane before the turn. This fact is independent of whether there is a
      cycling lane on the street. Turning left from a cycling lane on the
      right-hand side of the street is against the Rule of Expected Behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, bike "infrastructure" (if that's what we can call a painted
      line on the ground) is not always well thought-out and can encourage
      unsafe behavior. Note however that such cycling lanes could be used to
      make an L-turn instead.
    </p>

          lane. Same same but different.</b

    </figure>

    <h3>Route planning</h3>
    <p>
      Figuring out the best way to get somewhere on two wheels is one of the
      most important aspects of urban cycling. There are many factors to
      consider, but avoiding left turns at busy intersections is near the top of
      the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      What matters the most is the traffic on the street on which the cyclist is
      preparing the turn. Turning from a side street to a major artery (given
      there is a traffic light) is usually not a big deal, but the other way
      around can be more intimidating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes, avoiding left turns might mean that the morning and evening
      commutes take diffent routes. The simplistic example below shows how
      travelling between two locations is possible by always turning right in
      either direction. Of course, real-life situations are not often as simple
      as this one but you get the idea. By carefully studying the street grid
      along one's commute, it is sometimes possible to optimize it to minimize
      the amount of left turns, or at least make it such that they occur at
      intersections that are not so wide or busy.
