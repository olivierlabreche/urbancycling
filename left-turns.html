    <h2>Left Turns</h2>
    This sections describes the different ways in which a cyclist might handle a
    left turn at an intersection, as well as giving some safety and route
    planning tips.
    <h3>
      I learned how to turn when I was 5. Can we move on to the next topic?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Actually, left turns are one of the most tricky situations to handle for
      novice or experienced cyclists alike. They can be a source of confusion
      and stress, and even trigger conflicts between drivers and cyclists.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, it is important to carefully plan one's route to minimize
      the occurence of difficult left turns. When they cannot be avoided, one
      should ideally decide ahead of time what strategy will be used at a given
      intersection. In my experience, leaving that decision to the last minute
      can lead to impulsive and unsafe riding.
    </p>
    <h3>Right-hand traffic vs left-hand traffic</h3>
    <p>
      In most of the world, traffic keeps to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic"
        >right side of the road</a
      >. This being said, a around a third of the world population lives under
      left-hand traffic (LHT) rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Britain aside, many of the places that still have LHT are former British
      colonies, such as India, though there are others left-hand driving
      countries without a history of British colonialism like Japan and
      Indonesia.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you might have guessed, this page is written under the assumption of
      right-hand traffic, though the concepts are analoguous for right turns in
      left-hand traffic zones.
    </p>
    <h3>Defining the types of left turns</h3>
    <p>
      The following picture illustrates three common ways in which a cyclist can
      handle a left turn.

    <p>
      For the sake of this post, let's call them as follows (ordered in terms of
      preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</a></b> (in blue)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#l-turn">L-Turn</a></b> (in green)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#zigzag">The "Zigzag"</a></b> (in red)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</h3>
    <p>
      As the name hints, this type of turn simply consists in turning mostly
      like a car would. Although it sounds simple, many novice cyclists are
      intimidated by this maneuver because it involves taking space in the left
      lane, amongst traffic and far from the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ok not to feel comfortable turning this way and many cyclists who
      have ridden for a long time are still avoiding it. However, it can save
      time for those cyclists who feel at ease taking their share of the road.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before the turn, the cyclist signals left and steers towards the
        left-hand side of the road. Where exactly a cyclist should position
        himself depends on the type of intersection and number of lanes, but in
        general the center of the leftmost lane makes the most sense (more on
        positioning later).
      </li>

      <li>
        When the light turns green, the cyclist yields to the oncoming traffic
        in the other direction driving through the intersection or turning
        right.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is no longer any oncoming traffic, the cyclist turns left,
        sticking to the center of the left lane.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the 90&#176; turn is completed, the cyclist immediatly signals
        right and moves towards the right-hand side.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This turn is my personal favorite when it can be executed safely. In
      general, it is the fastest turn of the three as it requires at most a
      single traffic light cycle.
    </p>
    <h4>Difficulties and safety considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Yielding to right-turning traffic</b><br /><br />Sometimes there will
        be a lot of cars across the intersection that want to turn right,
        towards the same direction where you are heading. If you are lucky, one
        of those drivers will be nice enough to let you go through even though
        he has priority.<br /><br />This situation can be tricky when there are
        multiple lanes on the road where you are turning. A car facing this
        situation would typically turn in the left lane while the right-turning
        traffic would take the right one. This is not really an option for
        cyclists who are supposed to stick to the right-hand side once they
        finished their turn. If cars are waiting behind, they may become
        impatient. Remember that it's your right to wait in the left lane until
        you can safely turn.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Being overtaken from the right by a left-turning car</b><br /><br />
        Occasionally, a driver might take place on your right and turn left at
        the same time as you. This situation can happen if you are positioned
        too much towards the left-hand side or not clearly signalling your
        intention to turn left. Even if you did everything right, you may also
        simply be pushed around by an abusive driver who does not like waiting
        behind a cyclist.<br /><br />When that happens, you might not be able to
        move back towards the right-hand side of the street if there is a lot of
        left-turning traffic. That really sucks and the only way to get back to
        a safe position is to keep calm, signal right and hope that another car
        behind will let you get through. Prevention is always a good idea - by
        staying in the center of the left lane, it becomes harder for a car to
        pretend to ignore you.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Communication</b><br /><br />
        With this type of turn, clearly signalling your intention to turn left
        is extremely important. Many drivers are not aware that cyclists are
        perfectly entitled to turn from the left-hand side of the road.
        Sometimes cars might have arrived at the intersection later than you and
        did not see you steering and signalling to the left when you were taking
        position in the left lane. Ideally, one should stick out an arm during
        the whole time where one is waiting for the light to turn green. This
        can be bothersome. Personally, I will typically raise it every 10
        seconds or so, or when I hear a car arriving behind me.
