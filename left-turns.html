    <h2>Left Turns</h2>
    This sections describes the different ways in which a cyclist might handle a
    left turn at an intersection, as well as giving some safety and route
    planning tips.
    <h3>
      I learned how to turn when I was 5. Can we move on to the next topic?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Actually, left turns are one of the most tricky situations to handle for
      novice or experienced cyclists alike. They can be a source of confusion
      and stress, and even trigger conflicts between drivers and cyclists.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, it is important to carefully plan one's route to minimize
      the occurence of difficult left turns. When they cannot be avoided, one
      should ideally decide ahead of time what strategy will be used at a given
      intersection. In my experience, leaving that decision to the last minute
      can lead to impulsive and unsafe riding.
    </p>
    <h3>Right-hand traffic vs left-hand traffic</h3>
    <p>
      In most of the world, traffic keeps to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic"
        >right side of the road</a
      >. This being said, a around a third of the world population lives under
      left-hand traffic (LHT) rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Britain aside, many of the places that still have LHT are former British
      colonies, such as India, though there are others left-hand driving
      countries without a history of British colonialism like Japan and
      Indonesia.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you might have guessed, this page is written under the assumption of
      right-hand traffic, though the concepts are analoguous for right turns in
      left-hand traffic zones.
    </p>
    <h3>Defining the types of left turns</h3>
    <p>
      The following picture illustrates three common ways in which a cyclist can
      handle a left turn.
    </p>
    <img src="left-turn.png" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto" />
    <p>
      For the sake of this post, let's call them as follows (ordered in terms of
      preference):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</a></b> (in blue)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#l-turn">L-Turn</a></b> (in green)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="#zigzag">The "Zigzag"</a></b> (in red)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="drivers-turn">Driver's Turn</h3>
    <p>
      As the name hints, this type of turn simply consists in turning mostly
      like a car would. Although it sounds simple, many novice cyclists are
      intimidated by this maneuver because it involves taking space in the left
      lane, amongst traffic and far from the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ok not to feel comfortable turning this way and many cyclists who
      have ridden for a long time are still avoiding it. However, it can save
      time for those cyclists who feel at ease taking their share of the road.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before the turn, the cyclist signals left and steers towards the
        left-hand side of the road. Where exactly a cyclist should position
        himself depends on the type of intersection and number of lanes, but in
        general the center of the leftmost lane makes the most sense (more on
        positioning later).
      </li>

      <li>
        When the light turns green, the cyclist yields to the oncoming traffic
        in the other direction driving through the intersection or turning
        right.
      </li>
      <li>
        When there is no longer any oncoming traffic, the cyclist turns left,
        sticking to the center of the left lane.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the 90&#176; turn is completed, the cyclist immediatly signals
        right and moves towards the right-hand side.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This turn is my personal favorite when it can be executed safely. In
      general, it is the fastest turn of the three as it requires at most a
      single traffic light cycle.
    </p>
    <h4>Difficulties and safety considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Yielding to right-turning traffic</b><br /><br />Sometimes there will
        be a lot of cars across the intersection that want to turn right,
        towards the same direction where you are heading. If you are lucky, one
        of those drivers will be nice enough to let you go through even though
        he has priority.<br /><br />This situation can be tricky when there are
        multiple lanes on the road where you are turning. A car facing this
        situation would typically turn in the left lane while the right-turning
        traffic would take the right one. This is not really an option for
        cyclists who are supposed to stick to the right-hand side once they
        finished their turn. If cars are waiting behind, they may become
        impatient. Remember that it's your right to wait in the left lane until
        you can safely turn.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Being overtaken from the right by a left-turning car</b><br /><br />
        Occasionally, a driver might take place on your right and turn left at
        the same time as you. This situation can happen if you are positioned
        too much towards the left-hand side or not clearly signalling your
        intention to turn left. Even if you did everything right, you may also
        simply be pushed around by an abusive driver who does not like waiting
        behind a cyclist.<br /><br />When that happens, you might not be able to
        move back towards the right-hand side of the street if there is a lot of
        left-turning traffic. That really sucks and the only way to get back to
        a safe position is to keep calm, signal right and hope that another car
        behind will let you get through. Prevention is always a good idea - by
        staying in the center of the left lane, it becomes harder for a car to
        pretend to ignore you.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Communication</b><br /><br />
        With this type of turn, clearly signalling your intention to turn left
        is extremely important. Many drivers are not aware that cyclists are
        perfectly entitled to turn from the left-hand side of the road.
        Sometimes cars might have arrived at the intersection later than you and
        did not see you steering and signalling to the left when you were taking
        position in the left lane. Ideally, one should stick out an arm during
        the whole time where one is waiting for the light to turn green. This
        can be bothersome. Personally, I will typically raise it every 10
        seconds or so, or when I hear a car arriving behind me.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Moving left before reaching the intersection</b>
        <p>
          This is the trickest part and is a skill that is improved with
          practice. The cyclist has to be positioned left by the time he reaches
          the stop line of the intersection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes see novice cyclists suddently turning left from the
          right-hand side of the road once they reach the stop line. This is
          quite dangerous as the cyclist might cut off incoming traffic and
          surprise drivers. Because the cyclist has to look out both for traffic
          coming from behind and in the opposite direction, it is easy to make a
          mistake and fail to see a driver coming by.
        </p>
        <p>
          The better option is to make a move towards the left of the road ahead
          of the interestion, but it is not always easy. The ideal situation is
          when there is a gap in traffic around 10 seconds before arriving at
          the intersection, which makes it easy to move towards the left just in
          time and avoids staying there for an incomfortably long stretch of
          road.
        </p>
        <p>
          In theory the cyclist can move towards the left whenever the road is
          free behind him, which means that on busier roads he would be right to
          take his space on the left lane whenever conditions are safe to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          In practice, this can be intimidating and I wouldn't recommend it for
          busier streets with high-speed traffic. I have been honked and
          overtaken by the right a few times trying this approach on main
          arteries and it's an unnecessary stress that I don't need in my day.
          Some cyclists are able to keep their cool and might be able to calmly
          explain to toxic drivers why it is their right to be there. If this is
          you, please keep it up! In other cases, the L-turn might be a wiser
          choice. With time, you will get a feel for which situations you are or
          aren't comfortable with this maneuver.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="l-turn">L-Turn</h3>
    <p>
      This is the basic maneuver that most cyclists would instinctively perform
      when they need to make a left turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      With L-turns, the intersection is crossed in two steps and the cyclist
      always stays on the right-hand side of road. It is a perfectly fine turn,
      though maybe "boring", and well-suited to busy or large intersections.
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The cyclist approaches the intersection as he usually would if going
        straight, staying as far right as reasonable. One exception would be if
        the right-hand most lane is reserved for right-turning traffic, in which
        case the cyclist can move to the next lane.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the light turns green, the cyclist crosses the perpendicular street
        and aims towards the corner in front of him. The pedestrian cycle might
        also be used for this by walking or even riding carefully (dependent on
        local rules).
      </li>
      <li>
        The cyclist may optionally disembark the bike and wait on the sidewalk
        at the corner, until the other street may be crossed. Alternatively, the
        cyclist might wait on his bike in the curb near the corner. The decision
        depends on factors such as how busy the intersection is, the curb width
        or whether there are cycling lanes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cross the second traffic light when it is your turn and continue your
        way on the right-hand side of the street towards your destination.
        Again, walking or biking are two options here.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Difficulties and safety considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Changing the type of turn midway through</b>
        <p>
          In some cases, one might have been preparing for an L-turn but decided
          to change to a botched driver's turn at the last minute. This is
          tempting as it allows completing the maneuver in one single cycle. In
          my opinion, this is not a safe behavior and should be avoided, but
          hey, we're all humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find that it helps to plan the left-turn strategy ahead of time to
          prevent this impulsive move. If this happens a lot at a specific
          intersection on your commute, it might be a sign that it would be
          better handled through a driver's turn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Blocking traffic</b>
        <p>
          As a general rule, one should avoid blocking any type of traffic while
          waiting at the far corner (pedestrian, cycling or driving). If there
          are cycling or pedestrian lanes near where you are waiting, or if the
          car traffic comes close to the sidewalk, you want to make sure you are
          out of the way. This is usually the main reason why I would wait on
          the sidewalk as opposed to on the street.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Merging with traffic after the second crossing</b>
        <p>
          This danger can be easy to overlook. When doing an L-turn and crossing
          from corner to corner, the cyclist is separated from the car traffic.
          After the second crossing, the cyclist has to quickly merge back onto
          the street to take his place in the curb and avoid obstacles such as
          parked cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          When performed in a sudden manner, this move can surprise drivers, so
          it is important to signal your intention of merging back in the
          traffic, especially if the road is busy behind you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This issue is less of a problem if you positioned yourself to be in
          the curb with the traffic on the perpendicular street while waiting
          for the second crossing. In some situations, it makes sense to
          reposition oneself at the corner bewteen the 1st and 2nd crossings to
          be ready to hit the road when the light turns green.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="zigzag">The "Zigzag"</h3>
    <p>
      What I call the "zigzag" move consists in crossing the current street
      first, then the perpendicular street. In some ways it is a mirror image of
      the L-turn, but because there are three 90&#176; turns, it looks more like
      an ugly "Z" than a nice "L". As you might have guessed from the name, I
      find this maneuver tricky and dangerous and would not recommend it, unless
      done completely as a pedestrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main reason I am against this move is that it puts the cyclist on the
      left side of the street while crossing which is not natural. Turning cars
      tend to not to be watchful for cyclists circulating on the left-hand side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make things worse, a cyclist will be tempted to cross the first street
      from a high-speed riding position in the lane, suddenly making a sharp
      left turn towards an unnatural direction. In my opinion, moving with the
      flow of the traffic is a common-sense strategy which is preferable to this
      type of maneuver. I will not further discuss it here, but would love your
      feedback on this part, especially if you find this move useful for you!
