    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p><i>Warning: this page contains a fair amount of bike shedding!</i></p>

    There are various ways to store a bicycle. Some options include:
    <ul>
      <li>In a garage</li>
      <li>In a bike shed</li>
      <li>On a balcony</li>
      <li>Stored inside (e.g. wall mount)</li>
      <li>Locked against street furniture</li>
      <li>In the yard</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you have the chance to own a garage, I find this option to be the ideal
      storage location. However, this is not often the case for urban city
      dwellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bicycle should ideally be stored in a <b>dry</b> and <b>safe</b> place,
      but this is not always possible. Keeping a marriage alive involves
      compromises and not leaving a bike full of dirt and snow in the living
      room might be one of them!
    </p>

    <h3>Safety</h3>

    <p>
      Regarding safety, in my opinion a bike frame should be locked to something
      solid no matter which storage option is used (except maybe inside the
      house). I might be slightly paranoid but breaking into a garage or a shed
      is not something that is very hard for an experience theft. Regarding
      garages specifically, be also careful about alternate entrances such as a
      backdoor or window. I have heard sad stories about stolen bikes where the
      theft used back entrances that the owners did not think about securizing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another important safety aspect is visibility. If no one knows about a
      bicycle being stored somewhere, it runs much less chances of being stolen.
      This is why I would not recommend storing the bicycle in a yard, balcony
      or anywhere outside. Storing it permanently on public furniture is not
      something I would ever try (legal questions aside) as too exposed.
      However, sometimes it is necessary to lock a bike temporarily on public
      furniture. In this situation, one should be careful about not impeding the
      movement of pedestrians and handicaped people or strollers (access ramps
      are a common locking location).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, during winter, one has to be careful about sidewalk plowing
      equipment. In Montreal we have those catepillar vehicles that push the
      snow onto the street - the drivers of these things are not always mindful
      about bicycles and can damage them. I have even heard of competitions
      amongst those drivers as to who would break the most bikes!
    </p>

    <h3>Investing into locking equipment</h3>
    <p>
      To lock a bicycle, I prefer chains made of thick links to U-locks for
      their flexibility. Don't buy the tiny wire locks as these are worthless
      and easily cut by a thief. At the end of the day, any locking system can
      be broken, but the goal is to at least ensure that the thief requires
      special equipment and needs a significant amount of time to perform the
      theft, in which case he might give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a garage or shed that has a concrete floor, it is possible to install
      an anchor in the ground into which the bicycle may be locked. Some
      well-known locking solutions companies such as Abus and Kryptonite make
      them. These are not necessarily cheap but they represent a good investment
      in my opinion. I would say that investing up to 25% of the bicycle value
      into locking systems is worth it, so say 500$ for a 2000$ bike.
    </p>
    <p>
      When considering locking equipment, think about not just the value of the bicycle itself but the time
      investment placed into customizing it and even its "emotional" value to
      you, and the lost capability to commute when the bike is stolen. You
      should easily agree with me that investing a sizeable fraction of the bike value in its safety is not excessive at all when
      taking those factors into consideration. In any case, if your bike is ever
      stolen, you will most likely come to the conclusion that you should buy the necessary locking gear for your next one. At the end of the
      day you'll have to make that expense anyway, with the diffence being that
      now you'll have a stolen bike on top of this to account for.
    </p>

    <h3>Storage temperature considerations</h3>
    <p>
      I do not personally care for the storage location to be heated or not. In
      my experience, leaving a well winterized bicycle in an unheated spot is
      just fine. I use a bike shed which keeps snow and rain away from the bike
      and prevents rust. In fact based on my experience with cars I believe that an
      unheated space is even better than a heated one.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that really accelerates rust formation is a series of freeze-thaw cycles.
      There is nothing wrong about storing the bike permanently under 0 &#8451;,
      as long as the storage location is dry. The thought that the location
      should be heated up might come from the pervasive car culture in North
      America. Unlike a car, there are no battery or other electric equipment
      that risk not starting up on a standard bike.
    </p>

    <p>
      One situation where I find taking the bike to a heated place helps is
      during extreme cold waves (-20 &#8451; or less). On my bike, I noticed
      that the brake cables or callipers of my mechanical disc brakes
      become stiff in those conditions (not yet 100% sure about which component
      is the culprit here).
    </p>
    <p>
      In extremely cold conditions, once the bike levers are pulled, the brakes
      might not release again. As you may guess, riding against the bike's
      brakes is extremely draining! I find that when that happens, heating the
      bike after the morning commute might help, but even then the effect risks
      being temporary.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a minimum, it allows unblocking the brakes and saving the return
      commute. If only one out of the two brakes is problematic, one may then
      avoid using that one on the way back. I find that in winter the bike's
      natural deceleration is more important than in summer due to factors such
      as snow, lower tire pressure and higher friction of different parts such
      as the freewheel. It is possible to ride quite a distance without actually
      having to hit the brakes all that much.

  <h3>Water in cables</h3>
  <p>
    Another common source of problem when biking in the winter is water that is frozen
    inside cables. When this happens, it might be tempting to move the bike inside in
    the hope that it will "warm up" and dry. In this situation, like with cable stiffness, any
    "fix" that is introduced by heating the bike will be temporary and revert
    itself once the bike is ridden outside for a few minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sometimes, by hanging the bicycle vertically in a heated location (using a
  wall mount in the house for example), water that accumulated in the cable that
  might otherwise stay frozen if the bike was stored outside will melt and drop
  during the night. The bike will then be great to use on the next day!
  I once had a colleague who had the same bike as me. I would experience water in the cables and he wouldn't.
  I was puzzled by this until I realized that he was storing his bike vertically inside.
  Although I never tried it myself, I gave this trick to a few people and it seems to help them with this issue. </p>
