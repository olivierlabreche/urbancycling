    <h2>Carrying Cargo</h2>
    It is important to invest in a good luggage rack and quality bags. My waterproof Arkel bags allow carrying a laptop, clothes, a cell phone, a chain and more, safely.
    
    For daily trips to work, this is usually all the gear I need. It all fits in a single bag, which I find more convenient than two bags to carry around and leaves one side of the bike free of obstacles. This makes it easier to hop on and off the bike.
    
    I mainly use two bags when doing groceries or carrying stuff to the recycling center, such as empty bottles that have been piling up in the basement.

    For anything larger, I have a trailer which I got second hand for around 60$. The heaviest item I ever carried with this thing was a microwave, and it was surprisingly easy.

    We are a family of five. Anyone who tells you they "need" an SUV to carry groceries is delusional.
    
    When picking up our children from their school which is a few blocks from home, I'll often arrive from work on my bike and then walk it with the children, using it as a mule to carry their zillions of items. When the kids were smaller we were using a Thule chariot to carry them to and from daycare. The chariot was super convenient and could also be converted on the fly into a stroller. This was a useful feature as I could hitch them in the morning and my wife was walking them back home in the evening.
