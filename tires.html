    <h2>Winter Tires</h2>
    <p>
      When I bought my first "winter" bike in 2018, I was hoping that I could
      just ride out of the store and cycle all winter long. Then came the first
      storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It quickly became obvious that the "urban" tires that came with the bike
      were not enough, especially on smaller streets that don't see much
      traffic. They were simply slipping around and not providing enough
      traction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first winter, I just decided to store the bike away for the months of
      January and February, where Eastern Canada gets the most snow, and rode
      the metro instead. I thought that having a bike rideable 10 months out of
      12 was still great. And it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, public transit has never been my favorite means of
      transportation. It took me longer to commute than biking, even in winter,
      and I missed that feeling of being free to go anywhere at any time. The
      second winter, I decided it was time to upgrade those tires and try to get
      the most out of this bike. The LBS recommended studded tires and they had
      some Schwalbe Marathon Winter Plus in stock. I did not pounder much and
      bought a pair!
    </p>

    <h3>Starting with the Schwalbe Marathon Winter Plus</h3>
    <p>
      The Schwalbe Marathon Winter Plus (SMWP) is a great all-around winter tire
      when the street is reasonably plowed. It has four rows of studs providing
      great grip on ice and hard-packed snow. The thread pattern is tight and
      not very deep which gives it great rolling capability on asphalt.
    </p>

    <p>
      I equipped my bike with the 35mm version which is narrow enough to cut
      through piles of snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where the SMWP shine the most is after freezing rain. Whereas cars and
      pedestrians would really have a hard time moving around, these tires makes
      you feel like you are riding on pure asphalt. You can brake or turn quite
      hard and won't feel like you are losing an inch of control. Of course,
      there are limits, but with some common sense it's really hard to get
      destabilized. It was really quite a surprise to see that level of
      performance on ice on two wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I find that they can lack control on deeper snow,
      especially that which has been squished by cars and compacted into tracks.
      They do offer more grip than my summer tires in those conditions, and I
      could usually ride my way through, save during or right after heavy
      snowstorms. However, there are those moments when they can be uneasy to
      handle, when riding in the lesser plowed right hand side of the street for
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      With those tires, I found myself basically having to stop cycling for 2-3
      days after heavy snow, until streets got plowed and traffic created
      tracks. At the end of the day, these tires need a hard surface to be safe
      to ride.
    </p>
    <h3>Note on mounting the SMWP</h3>
    <p>
      I have changed my own tires since I was 14 and never really had any
      issues. However, I must say that those SWMP are extremely difficult to
      install and remove! I even broke a tire lever doing so and had to buy
      metal core ones from Park tools to make sure it would not happen again. I
      could see someone giving up and having to go to the LBS for this usually
      simple operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a big downside to me as winter biking involves changing tires at
      least twice a year. I get that they have reinforced lining for puncture
      resistance, but in my opinion, these tires are more appropriate for a
      separate winter bike (or hiring a mechanic).
    </p>
    <h2>Choosing a different set of tires</h2>
    <p>
      This year, I went on the lookout for a new set of tires to help on those
      days where there is a bit more snow and steering is tricky. For a given
      bike, winter tires basically have three parameters to choose from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Studs</li>
      <li>Width</li>
      <li>Threads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I wanted to keep studded tires for those icy days. There is nothing worse
      than hitting a patch of ice while braking on studless tires. One question
      that came up is the ideal tire width. For now, I decided to keep the width
      in the mid-30s which I feel is more appropriate for urban settings than
      wider tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I could gather, slightly wider tires just grip less while not
      providing enough float on snow to make a difference, unless going all the
      way to a fatbike. One thing I did want to improve was the thread pattern
      to help with steering in the snow.
    </p>
    <h3>Finnish spirit with the W106</h3>
    <p>
      After some research, the Suomi Hakkapeliitta W106 seemed like a good fit.
      Suomi is the former bike tires division of Nokian which has been sold and
      renamed. As a side note, it looks like the Hakkapeliitta tire has been
      rebranded as Kide which I find a shame personally - Finnish words for
      winter equipment just sound cooler!
    </p>
    <p>
      These tires have 2 rows of studs instead of 4 on the SMWP but have a
      deeper thread pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had to order them from the US as I did not find a distributor in Canada
      (though I did not look very hard). The version I ordered is the 37-622,
      which fortunately
      <a href="www.peterwhitecycles.com">Peter White Cycles</a> still had in
      stock, though not anymore. If anyone knows how to procure those in Canada
      easily, I would love it if you could shoot me a message!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just installed them and am yet to be able to give a fully balanced
      review. The installation was a breeze, there is absolutely no comparison
      with the reinforced liner of the SMWP! That is definitely a big plus to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that came as a surprise is that they definitely look narrower
      than the SMWP despite the Suomi being nominally 37 mm in size, versus 35
      mm for the SMWP. I rode them during a very heavy storm and found that the
      bike was easier control when following compacted car tracks than it would
      have been with my former tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tire pressure seems important, less pressure in front really helped in
      difficult conditions. I yet have to test them on ice - I am curious to see
      whether the reduced number of stud rows will make a difference here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: I will update this entry when I have a better overall appreciation
      of them!
